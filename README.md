# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Project Overview

This project involves predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model built in Python. The dataset includes historical stock prices, and the project leverages machine learning techniques to generate accurate forecasts. Visualizations are included to present insights into stock trends and patterns.

## Key Features

### Data Collection & Cleaning
- Collected historical stock price data.
- Managed missing values and ensured data consistency for optimal model performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized stock price trends to identify key patterns and fluctuations.
- Applied descriptive statistics to summarize data insights.

### Model Development
- Implemented an LSTM model for effective time series prediction.
- Utilized train-test splitting and data scaling for improved model accuracy.

### Visualizations
- Plotted actual vs predicted stock prices to assess model performance.
- Illustrated key trends and insights through line charts and visual comparisons.
